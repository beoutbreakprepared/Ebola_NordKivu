# Travel time analytics for the Ebola outbreak in the Kivus

With the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we were interested in applying openly available data to quantify the
travel time of populations impacted by Ebola.

The base travel time statistics are generated from friction layers evaluated by Daniel Weiss and colleagues at the Malaria Atlas Project
and shared via their R package malariaAtlas https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/malariaAtlas/index.html
Case data comes from Situation Reports from the World Health Organization and Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Calculate and plot travel time to health areas infected with Ebola from surrounding area using publicly available data.
The plots produced with this code are displayed below:
